**NOTE**: Check stm32f103_dual_vcp.ioc for detial.

**NOTE**: If you encountered the multiple re-definition issues when compiling 
    the source code, check the Makefile and remove any duplicate files in
    C_SOURCES instruction.

## Programming tips

### USB dual CDC VCP configuration.

To support dual class in single device, you have to add IAD(Interface Association Descriptor) to USBD_CDC_CfgFSDesc or USBD_CDC_CfgHsDesc depends on which 
full-speed or high-speed you are using.

USBD_CDC_CfgFSDesc and USBD_CDC_CfgHSDesc can be found in 
/src/stm32f103_dual_vcp/Middlewares/ST/STM32_USB_Device_Library/Class/CDC/Src/usbd_cdc.c
/src/stm32f103_dual_vcp/Middlewares/ST/STM32_USB_Device_Library/Class/CDC/Inc/usbd_cdc.h

There are two template files /src/stm32f103_dual_vcp/usbd_cdc-dual_vcp-template.[ch]. 
Use them to overwrite usbd_cdc.[ch] files.

**NOTE**: usbd_cdc.[ch] are generated by STM32CubeMx. So, you have to repeat the overwriting action whenever you re-generate code from STM32CubeMx.

### USB event callback

There are several important USB callbacks function should be taken care of. 

#### UART configuration

There is a switch-case in usbd_cdc_if.c::CDC_Control_FS() and usbd_cdc_if.c::CDC_Control_HS(). 
It is used to configure UART property. The request is sent from host via USB.

STM32 has a predefined structure USBD_CDC_LineCodingTypeDef which can be used to represent 
the structure of line coding request.

```
    USBD_CDC_LineCodingTypeDef *line_coding = (USBD_CDC_LineCodingTypeDef *)pbuf;
```
